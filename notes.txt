~ = approximately that version 
x.y.z: Z is small patches; Y = minor updates; X = a breaking change of the package

npm install        install all the dependencies in your project
npm install <foo>  add the <foo> dependency to your project
npm test           run this project's tests
npm run <foo>      run the script named <foo>

npm -l             display usage info for all commands
npm help <term>    search for help on <term> (in a browser)
npm help npm       more involved overview (in a browser)
